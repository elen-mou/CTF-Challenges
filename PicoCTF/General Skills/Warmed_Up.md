### Challenge: Warmed Up
### Points: 50
The author of this challenge asks you `What is 0x3D (base 16) in decimal (base 10)?`. 
In order to solve that we need to convert this hexadecimal number to decimal using `printf` with the `%d` format specifier on your shell which is used to indicate that the corresponding argument should be formatted as a decimal integer.

```bash
User@Github:~$ printf "%d\n" 0x3d
61
```
