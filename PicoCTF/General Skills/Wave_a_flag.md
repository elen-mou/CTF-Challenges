### Challenge: Wave a flag
### Points: 10

The author of this challenge gives us a binary file. In order to run this file you need to type `./warm` on your terminal. 
```bash
User@Github:~$ ./warm 
Hello user! Pass me a -h to learn what I can do!
```
This will print a message that says to run the program again but this time with the `-h` flag. So now if you run `./warm -h` you will get another message with the flag.

```bash
User@Github:~$ ./warm -h
Oh, help? I actually don't do much, but I do have this flag here: picoCTF{........_..._....._........}
```
