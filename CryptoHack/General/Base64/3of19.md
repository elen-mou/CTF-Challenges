### Challenge: Base64

Another common encoding scheme is Base64, which allows us to represent binary data as an ASCII string using an alphabet of 64 characters. One character of a Base64 string encodes 6 binary digits (bits), and so 4 characters of Base64 encode three 8-bit bytes.

Base64 is most commonly used online, so binary data such as images can be easily included into HTML or CSS files.

Take the hex string below, decode it into bytes and then encode it into Base64.
